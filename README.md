# Audio-Player
A play list made with HTML, CSS and JS

Problems that the audio player has:

-The duration numbers are a bit far from each other
- When the first song starts the album is moving but without the music playing, 
  when they click to start, the image stops and the music starts. It starts moving again when paused, this only happens in the first song.
